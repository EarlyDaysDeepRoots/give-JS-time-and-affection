# Introduction
A life hit the biggest lucky, in his way of life midway, namely in the prime of life in he found his mission.

The learning process for a programming language can be challenging for an adult, despite the fact that there are a number of tutorials, courses, and books available. For someone like me, who is a computer science layman as well as a non-native English speaker, they seem to contain a wealth of difficult-to-digest information. A roadmap for learning JavaScript for beginners can be found easily online. However, a beginner’s ability to read it is limited. It can be frustrating from the very beginning to realize this fact. 

When a teacher is teaching the right things to the students, he or she usually keeps quiet about their own frustrations. In addition, some teaching resources found on the Internet are intentionally simplified. In reality, we know very few details about what happens on the journey from rookie to expert. People are less likely to describe or document the many puzzles or problems they encounter when learning a programming language. A beginner who ignores this implicit or invisible information can make mistakes or take the wrong path during the rest of his learning process. 

Being a rookie doesn’t have to be a bad thing. In the Moon Speech, John F. Kennedy (JFK) said, “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept. One we are unwilling to postpone.”
